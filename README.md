# Swim Feedback
For the class: 2.4 HBO-ICT

In this group project, three software engineer students (including me), two infrastructure students and one business student came together to make a program for InnoSportLab de Tongelreep. The main purpose of the program is to make it easy for the kids in InnoSportLab's swimming classes to give feedback. Employees can then see this feedback through various statistics. The data is saved on AWS. The strict rules in the Netherlands around data involving children have been carefully followed.
